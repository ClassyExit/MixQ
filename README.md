## What's this?

Think of when you're hosting a party and you're trying to figure out the music part.
You don't want everyone passing around your phone or coming up to your laptop and putting in their songs.
Instead you can set this up on a central device like a TV and people can input their songs into a queue
using their own device by scanning the QR code or inputting the room code.

#### How are songs played?

The application is currently integrated with Youtube embedded to play songs.

#### How do I set it up?

Use a central device (laptop, tablet) and attach to a TV or a big screen where others can see it. People can then
scan the QR code when a room is created to add songs to the queue
